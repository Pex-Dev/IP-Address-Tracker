## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS Styles
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

During this project, I deepened my understanding of React by learning how to create reusable components and pass information between them using props. I also gained practical experience with the Context API for managing global state efficiently. Additionally, I improved my knowledge of Tailwind CSS, using it to quickly implement responsive and visually appealing designs. This project helped me solidify these skills while working on a real-world application.
  
### Continued development

In the coming months, I plan to deepen my understanding of React by exploring more advanced features such as custom hooks, state management techniques, and performance optimization. Additionally, I want to enhance my proficiency in creating responsive and visually appealing designs using Tailwind CSS. By focusing on these areas, I aim to build more dynamic, efficient, and user-friendly applications.

### Useful resources

- [React Leaflet](https://www.example.com) - It was very helpful to integrate the map with REACT more easily.
